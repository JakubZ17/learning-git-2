        <h1>Plastic Heart</h1>
        <h4>Nostalghia</h4>
          <p>You look for me inside the dark<br>
          I am the ocean, you are the shark<br>
          You hunt me like your last goodbye<br>
          Oh, fallen angel of the night<br></p>
          <p>Just take my heart, just rip it out<br>
          This holy skin it's falling out<br>
          I lay my body on the bed<br>
          One day, someday, you know I will see you again<br></p>
          <p>I put my hand against your plastic heart<br>
          No, suicide is not the plan, stand up<br>
          Even the stars are trapped inside, oh my<br>
          There's nothing left to hide<br>
          There's nothing left to die<br>
          There's nothing left to die<br></p>
          <p>I put my hand against your plastic heart<br>
          No, suicide is not the plan, stand up<br>
          Even the stars are trapped inside, oh my<br>
          There's nothing left to hide<br>
          There's nothing left to die<br>
          There's nothing left to die<br></p>
          <p>Plastic heart<br>
          No, suicide is not the plan, stand up<br>
          Even the stars are trapped inside, oh my<br>
          There's nothing left to hide<br>
          There's nothing left to die<br>
          There's nothing left to die</p>
